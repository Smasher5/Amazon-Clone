# Amazon-Clone
This project is a basic Amazon Clone created using only HTML and CSS, aiming to replicate the front-end layout and design of the Amazon homepage. It features a visually structured interface, including elements like the navigation bar, search bar, product sections, banners, and footer â€” closely mimicking the look and feel of the original site.
